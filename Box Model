        <H1>THE EUROPEAN AIR FORCES</H1>
        <P>The europian countries were way ahead in air forces in the 90s,
        The advanced technologies and proffessional army caps made them one 
        of the powerful nations in the world.Britain in the 1990s maintained 
        a strong fleet of military aircraft for defence and international 
        missions. The Royal Air Force operated advanced planes like the Tornado,
        Harrier, and Jaguar, which were used for surveillance, bombing, and 
        rapid response. These aircraft played key roles in conflicts such as 
        the Gulf War and peacekeeping operations.
